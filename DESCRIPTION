Description: Functions for fitting Semi-Markovian multi-state models. Constructs 
    and optimises the likelihood for arbitrary multi-state models where the possible 
    state transitions can be described by a directed acyclic graph with one or more
    initial states and one or more absorbind states. Designed for data where the exact 
    state transitions are not necessarily observed, so that we have interval censoring of 
    the transition times. Data like these are sometimes referred to as panel data.
