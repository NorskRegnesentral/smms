# smms: Semi-Markov Multi-State models for interval censored data

The `smms` package allows you to fit Semi-Markovian multi-state models to panel datasets. The package constructs and optimises the likelihood of arbitrary multi-state models where the possible state transitions can be described by an acyclic graph with one or more initial states and one or more absorbing states. 

Designed for data where the exact state transitions are not necessarily observed, so that we have interval censoring of the transition times. Data like these are sometimes referred to as panel data.

The methodology is explained in the paper [A new framework for semi-Markovian parametric multi-state models with interval censoring](https://www.mn.uio.no/math/english/research/projects/focustat/publications_2/multistate_final_july2022.pdf) by Aastveit, Cunen and Hjort (2022). The code used for the application and simulations in the paper is available in the `scripts` folder.


## Installation

In order to directly install the package from github, you need the package `devtools`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("NorskRegnesentral/smms")
```

## Overview


The main function in this package is the `smms` function, which is used to fit a multi-state model. The user needs to provide a datasets of states and time-points for multiple units of observation, typically referred to as *patients*, a graph describing the states and the possible transitions between them, and a set of parametric densities, and survival functions. 

In the next section, we will illustrate the use of the `smms` function in a simple example.

## A simple example

### Data

We will use the CAV dataset from the `msm` package (Jackson 2011) as an illustration. The dataset monitors a number of patients for a number of years after heart transplantation. Coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a condition potentially occurring after hear transplantation. At each time-point the patients are assigned to one of four states: well, mild CAV, severe CAV and death. The time of death is recorded precisely, but the times of entrance into the CAV-states are interval censored

Here we see the observations belonging to two patients. Note here that the states were originally numbered from 1 to 4, but for the sake of this illustration I have changed the state names to "well", "mild", "severe" and "death". This is to demonstrate that the package accepts names as both numbers and strings.  After deleting some observations that are deemed incorrect (because they appear to get better, see next paragraph), we end up with 2398 observations in 556 different patients.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(smms)
library(igraph) # For specifying the multi-state graph 
library(msm) # To get the CAV dataset

dd = cav
dd = dd[!is.na(dd$pdiag),]

# Remove observations where the patient appears to go back to a previous state (assumed to be impossible):
id_wrong = unique(dd$PTNUM[which(dd$state!=dd$statemax)])  
dd = dd[-which(dd$PTNUM %in% id_wrong),]

# Change state names from 1,2,3,4 to well, mild, severe, death
tab = data.frame(state=1:4,name=c("well","mild","severe","death"))
dd$state = tab$name[match(dd$state,tab$state)]

dd = dd[ ,-c(2, 5, 7, 9, 10)]
colnames(dd)[1:2] <- c("patient","time") # rename relevant columns (necessary in current version)

print(dd[1:11,])
```

### Specifying the model graph

Here we assume a four-state illness death model, since we consider CAV to be irreversible (so we do not allow for patients to move back to less severe states). It is convenient to stick to the same state names as in the dataset when specifying the model graph. 

```{r}
# Specify the graph:
gg = graph_from_literal("well"--+"mild"--+"severe"--+"death", "well"--+"death", "mild"--+"death")
par(mar=c(1,1,1,1))
plot(gg,layout=layout_with_sugiyama(gg,layers=c(1,1,1,2))$layout,vertex.size=40)
```
### Specifying parametric models 

Then, the user has to specify parametric models for all transition times (meaning one for each edge in the graph). In the current version of the package, these models have to be specified by providing density functions (in a specific format detailed below), as well as the corresponding survival functions. The functions will look like the following if one chooses to use simple exponential models for all transitions (i.e. meaning that we are fitting a homogeneous Markov model which could have been fitted with the `msm`package too - but this is for the sake of a simple illustration):

```{r}
f_01 = function(param, x, tt){dexp(tt,exp(param[1]))}
f_12 = function(param, x, tt){dexp(tt,exp(param[2]))}
f_23 = function(param, x, tt){dexp(tt,exp(param[3]))}
f_03 = function(param, x, tt){dexp(tt,exp(param[4]))}
f_13 = function(param, x, tt){dexp(tt,exp(param[5]))}

S_01 = function(param, x, tt){1-pexp(tt,exp(param[1]))}
S_12 = function(param, x, tt){1-pexp(tt,exp(param[2]))}
S_23 = function(param, x, tt){1-pexp(tt,exp(param[3]))}
S_03 = function(param, x, tt){1-pexp(tt,exp(param[4]))}
S_13 = function(param, x, tt){1-pexp(tt,exp(param[5]))}
```

Important to note:

* **the names of the functions**: these have to be in the form `f_ij` and `S_ij` with i indicating the source state (in the internal numbering system) and j indicating the receiving state. More details on the naming convention below.
* **the arguments of the functions**: these should always be given as `(param, x, tt)` as above. `x` will point to the vector of measured covariates (for a patient) when these are present. When there are no covariates, like in this example, `x` should still be present as an argument, but will not be called within the functions. In the vignettes we include examples with covariates.
* **the scale of the parameters**: for the sake of stable optimisation it is convinient that the parameters live on the real line (instead of the positive half-line as in the common parameterisation of the exponential distribution). Therefore, we include an exponential transformation of the `param` vector, and we recommend that transformation for all positive parameters.
* **the ordering of the parameters**: `param`denotes the full parameter vector for the model.
* Survival functions should be written so that they return 1 when `tt` is negative. Using build-in R CDFs for distributions over the positive half-line will ensure this. Otherwise, if the user codes the survival functions herself, she should ensure that they return 1 when `tt`is negative. We include an example with user-specified distribution functions in the vignettes.

As we saw above, the user has to follow a strict naming convention when specifying the densities and survival functions: within the package, the states are numbered from 0 to k-1 (k being the number of states), in a specific order which depends on the graph. To find out how the user defined state names relate to the internal numbering system, use the `names_of_survival_density` function.  This allways recommended before specifying the model:

```{r}
print(names_of_survival_density(gg))
```
Here we see for example that the density for the edge between "mild" and "severe" should be named `f_12`(as we do above).
