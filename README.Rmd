# smms: Semi-Markov Multi-State models for interval censored data

The `smms` package allows you to fit Semi-Markovian multi-state models to panel datasets. The package constructs and optimises the likelihood of arbitrary multi-state models where the possible state transitions can be described by an acyclic graph with one or more initial states and one or more absorbing states. 

Designed for data where the exact state transitions are not necessarily observed, so that we have interval censoring of the transition times. Data like these are sometimes referred to as panel data.

The methodology is explained in the paper [A new framework for semi-Markovian parametric multi-state models with interval censoring](https://www.mn.uio.no/math/english/research/projects/focustat/publications_2/multistate_final_july2022.pdf) by Aastveit, Cunen and Hjort (2022). The code used for the application and simulations in the paper is available in the `scripts` folder.


## Installation

In order to directly install the package from github, you need the package `devtools`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("NorskRegnesentral/smms")
```

## Overview


The main function in this package is the `smms` function, which is used to fit a multi-state model. The user needs to provide a datasets of states and time-points for multiple units of observation, typically referred to as *patients*, a graph describing the states and the possible transitions between them, and a set of parametric densities, and survival functions. 

In the next section, we will illustrate the use of the `smms` function in a simple example.

## A simple example

We will use the CAV dataset from the `msm` package (Jackson 2011) as an illustration. The dataset monitors a number of patients for a number of years after heart transplantation. Coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a condition potentially occurring after hear transplantation. At each time-point the patients are assigned to one of four states: well, mild CAV, severe CAV and death. The time of death is recorded precisely, but the times of entrance into the CAV-states are interval censored

Here we see the observations belonging to two patients. Note here that the states were originally numbered from 1 to 4, but for the sake of this illustration I have changed the state names to "well", "mild", "severe" and "death". This is to demonstrate that the package accepts names as both numbers and strings.  

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(smms)
library(igraph) # For specifying the multi-state graph 
library(msm) # To get the CAV dataset

dd = cav
dd = dd[!is.na(dd$pdiag),]

# Remove observations where the patient appears to go back to a previous state (assumed to be impossible):
id_wrong = unique(dd$PTNUM[which(dd$state!=dd$statemax)])  
dd = dd[-which(dd$PTNUM %in% id_wrong),]

# Change state names from 1,2,3,4 to well, mild, severe, death
tab = data.frame(state=1:4,name=c("well","mild","severe","death"))
dd$state = tab$name[match(dd$state,tab$state)]

dd = dd[ ,-c(2, 5, 7, 9, 10)]
colnames(dd)[1:2] <- c("patient","time") # rename relevant columns (necessary in current version)

print(dd[1:11,])
```

Next we specify the model graph. Here we assume a four-state illness death model, since we consider CAV to be irreversible (so we do not allow for patients to move back to less severe states). It is convenient to stick to the same naming/numbering when specifying the model graph. 

```{r}
# Specify the graph:
gg = graph_from_literal("well"--+"mild"--+"severe"--+"death", "well"--+"death", "mild"--+"death")
par(mar=c(2,2,2,2))
plot(gg,layout=layout_with_sugiyama(gg,layers=c(1,1,1,2))$layout,vertex.size=40)
```
