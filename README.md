# smms: Semi-Markov Multi-State models for interval censored data
Functions for fitting Semi-Markovian multi-state models. Constructs and optimises the likelihood for arbitrary multi-state models where the possible state transitions can be described by a directed acyclic graph with one or more initial states and one or more absorbing states. Designed for data where the exact state transitions are not necessarily observed, so that we have interval censoring of the transition times. Data like these are sometimes referred to as panel data.
