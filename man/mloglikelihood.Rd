\title{Calculate the negative log-likelihood}
\usage{
mloglikelihood(
  param,
  integrand,
  limits,
  X = NULL,
  method1 = "hcubature",
  mc_cores = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{param}{The parameter values in which the log-likelihood should be evaluated. The dimension
and ordering is given by the user-specified densities.}

\item{limits}{A nested list with the limits of integration for a set of patients. The length of the
outer list corresponds to the number of patients, the lengths of the inner lists correspond to the
the number of different paths the patient may have travelled.}

\item{X}{A matrix with the covariates. Number of rows equal to the number of patients and one column
for each covariate. The covariate specification is given by the user-specified densities.}

\item{mc_cores}{The number of cores to use (for parallelisation). The function uses the mclapply()
function from the parallel package.}

\item{integrands}{A nested list with the integrand(s) for a set of patients. The length of the
outer list corresponds to the number of patients, the lengths of the inner lists correspond to the
the number of different paths the patient may have travelled.}

\item{cmethod}{The integration method of choice for the cubintegrate() function. Only for integrals
of higher dimension than 2. Defaults to "hcubature".}
}
\value{
The value of the negative log-likelihood corresponding to the dataset and parameters provided.
}
\description{
Computes the negative log-likelihood for a set of patients, given by two nested lists "integrand"
and "limits".
