\title{Fit a semi-Markovian multistate model}
\usage{
smms(
  startval,
  data,
  graph,
  X = NULL,
  mc_cores = 3,
  hessian_matrix = FALSE,
  cmethod = "hcubature"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{startval}{The parameter values where the optimisation routine will start. The dimension
and ordering is given by the user-specified densities.}

\item{data}{A data frame where the number of rows correspond to the total number of observations for all patients,
and  with 3 columns: patient (numbering or names for each patient), time (the time when a patient was observed),
state (the state which the patient occupies at the observation time). FOR NOW!!}

\item{graph}{A directed, acyclic graph giving the multistate structure, in the igraph format (igraph package).}

\item{X}{A matrix with the covariates. Number of rows equal to the number of patients and one column
for each covariate. The covariate specification is given by the user-specified densities.}

\item{mc_cores}{The number of cores to use (for parallelisation). The function uses the mclapply()
function from the parallel package.}

\item{hessian_matrix}{Whether the hessian matrix (observed Fisher information matrix) for the parameter estimates
should be calculated or not.}

\item{cmethod}{The integration method of choice for the cubintegrate() function. Only for integrals
of higher dimension than 2. Defaults to "hcubature".}
}
\value{
The result from optimising the log-likelihood: parameter estimates with corresponding variance-covariance
matrix if variance_matrix = TRUE, and the maximum log-likelihood value.
}
\description{
The function the user should interact with. Assumes that the user has provided densities and
survival functions of the right format (ideally with all parameters living on -Inf to Inf -
to avoid having to set lower limits for some parameters).
